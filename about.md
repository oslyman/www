This site contains my thoughts on a variety of topics, including systems thinking, minimalism, stoicism, linguistics, history, financial idependence, investing, resistence training etc. I am attempting to publish something weekly. I will also revise previous posts as my thinking evolves. Historical versions of the website and all its posts can be found in its [github repository](https://github.com/oslyman/www).

The site is built with [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and aesthetically inspired by [Motherfucking Website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com). The content is meant to stand on its own. If you want to search the site, most search engines will support `site:oliverlyman.net <your query here>`. If you are interesting in creating something similar, I wrote [an article](/posts/static-site-in-a-browser) covering how to do so.
