There are many articles on the web discussing a wide variety of one kettlebell workouts and one kettlebell programs that last two or eight or 12 weeks. What I want to explore is the possibility of using one kettlebell as a permanent fitness solution.

I do not have enough experience to assert that this will work, but I have been, and will continue to experiment with it. For me, the correct weight is 24kg; for others, the weight may be higher or lower. When I first bought it, I could barely carry it, I could barely swing it, I definitely couldn't press or snatch or clean it. Over time I have added these and other skills, but I am far from mastering it.

My theory is that, along with occasional blocks of focused strength with barbells, other kettlebells and other implements, I should be able to build and maintain an adequate level of strength with this one bell. These focused blocks can serve to more quickly build particular strengths and skills. The kettlebell work should then maintain that strength for long periods of time.

Perhaps I am too enamored with the purity and simplicity of such an approach, but I have seen hints in my reading of various strength and fitness books that this may work.^[e.g. Dan John's discussions of park and bus bench programs, and Pavel's results with very submaximal weights in *The Quick and the Dead*.] I will return and update this post below with information as I progress.
