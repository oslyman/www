> *If it is important, do it every day. If it's not important, don't do it at all.*

This quotation is used extensively by Dan John, a weighlifting coach of whom I'm a fan. He uses it to discuss practicing the fundemental human movements, but it has broader applicability.

Daily practice has a number of benefits. It reinforces the neural pathways associated with the activity. The frequency of firing ensures those pathways grow stronger.^[For an extensive discussion of the neuroscience of learning, I recommend *The Talent Code* by Daniel Coyle.]
It reduces the pressure on any particular day's effort. No single session is particularly important.
It ensures progress is made. For substantial goals, the total amount of work can seem insurmountable, but even the smallest amount of daily progress will add up quickly.^[e.g. Terry Pratchett wrote 400 words a day and produced dozens of novels over his lifetime.]

Additionally, committing to daily action forces a global focus. It is not possible to pursue 100 activities on a daily basis. By deciding what is important and pruning the rest, I gain clarity on what my priorities are. Either they become daily habits as a result or I reassess my priorities in the face of the reality of my choices.

On a more practical note, I am going to commit to the following daily activities:
- the Dan Martin Program Minimum (as found in Dan John's [Lifetime Warrior PDF](https://danjohn.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/LIfetime-Warrior-Workouts.pdf))
- walking
- writing for this blog
- reading

Walking and reading are current habits. The others are new habits I wish to cultivate. In all cases, I will miss days, but I will aim to follow James Clear's advice in *Atomic Habits* and never miss twice. I hope over time to add to this list, but I am intentionally starting out with a manageable set initially.
