Total market index funds are the best investment option for most investors.

## Beta v. alpha ##
Investing theory breaks all returns into two components: alpha and beta. Beta is the total return to all investors in the market. Alpha represents the difference between beta and the return of a specific investor (or investment). For instance, if the US stock market returned 5%, but your investments returned 3%, beta is 5% and alpha -2%.

Alpha and beta are paired concepts. Because beta is the market return, market alpha is always zero. For an individual investor, positive alpha comes from negative alpha for a different investor. Alpha is zero sum.

Beta is not. Every investor is entitled to beta by investing.^[The issue of whether or not returns will generally be positive is discussed below] Not every investor receives their portion of beta; negative alpha represents this failure. But they could.

Total market index funds enable an investor to capture their allotment of beta with no risk of negative alpha. But they must give up positive alpha as well. This is less of a sacrifice than it might seem. Alpha is competitive. Every win is a loss for another. Beta is cooperative. The entire market can benefit together.

The competitive structure of alpha suffers from a tragedy of the commons. All alpha strategies cannot succeed at the same time. Therefore you must beat other investors, at least some of whom are more motivated, better informed or simply more insightful than you. There is also no requirement that alpha is evenly distributed. One investor could capture 100% of the available positive alpha, leaving the rest with negative beta. So you cannot simply be better than average. By contrast, the cooperative structure of beta suffers from none of these flaws. 
Cooperative structures are inherently better because no tragedy of the commons, you don't have to beat other more motivated, better informed etc investors TODO

## Efficient market hypothesis ##
Despite the structural advantages of beta, the lure of positive alpha is strong. You must possess talent in at least one domain to accumulate capital. Only capturing beta requires humility. The efficient market hypothesis explains why humility is warranted.

What does EMH say

Higher order perdiction, irrationality

Conclude with humility not about company knowledge, but about knowledge of emotions of market participants as well
